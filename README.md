# OIBSIP Java Programming

This repository contains two tasks assigned to me by Oasis Infobyte under their Internship Program. I developed these programs using Java.

These tasks are part of a larger project where I will utilize my gained practical experience in Java programming.


## ATMInterface

The ATMInterface program is a console-based ATM application. It allows users to register, log in, and perform various banking operations such as viewing balance, withdrawing, depositing, transferring, and viewing transaction history. The user data is stored in a HashMap for simplicity, but in a real-world scenario, a database would be used for secure data storage. This program demonstrates basic Java concepts, including classes, methods, control structures, and data manipulation.

## NumberGuessingGame

The NumberGuessingGame program is a simple Java game where the user guesses a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game prompts the user for the range and gives them 10 rounds to guess the number. After each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. This program showcases basic user input, random number generation, and conditional statements in Java.

Both programs are developed as console-based applications for ease of demonstration. They serve as foundational projects to showcase Naman Malik's Java programming skills and problem-solving abilities during the internship.

### ATMInterface

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the 'ATMInterface' directory using the command line or terminal.
3. Compile the Java code: `javac ATMInterface.java`
4. Run the program: `java ATMInterface`

### NumberGuessingGame

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the 'NumberGuessingGame' directory using the command line or terminal.
3. Compile the Java code: `javac NumberGuessingGame.java`
4. Run the program: `java NumberGuessingGame`

Follow the on-screen instructions in both programs to interact with the applications.
